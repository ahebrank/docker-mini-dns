# docker-machine DNS server

This package fires up a tiny (< 100 lines) DNS server whose sole purpose
is to listen for *.docker DNS lookups and resolve the hostname using 
`docker-machine ip`.

## How it works:

  * DNS query for dev.docker comes in
  * Server parses out "dev.docker"
  * Server responds with the result of `$(docker-machine ip dev)`

## Setup:

### The easy way

Run this: 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver		
sudo chown -R $USER /etc/resolver		
```

This creates the `/etc/resolver` directory (if it doesn't already exist)
and grants ownership to your current user account.  The service will
automatically configure the resolver/docker file on each run, making it
"just work".

### The way that doesn't require changing ownership of /etc/resolver

Write this to `/etc/resolver/docker` and always run with the same specified port

```
nameserver	127.0.0.1
port	12345
search_order	300000
timeout	1
```

**Note**: the whitespace separators in this file **NEED** to be tabs.  Spaces won't work.

## Example:

```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM

dev2            virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376
dev3            virtualbox   Stopped

docker-machine-dns can take a UDP port as its first (and only) argument
to bind to that specific port instead of randomly picking one on each run.
